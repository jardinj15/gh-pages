                <h1>1900-1939</h1>
                <h2>The most important technologic discovery</h2>
                <p>The most important technological discovery in the era of 1900-1939 would be the airplane. I selected this technology as the most important because it changed the world in many ways including military and civilian usage. The airplane is used every day by many people in order to travel from point A to point B faster than by boat.</p>
                <h2>The person(s) responsible for brining this technology to the public</h2>
                <p>The Wright brothers are responsible for bringing this technology to the public. The two brothers stared in a bike shop and then moved into aircraft starting with a glider and then adding control and finally power in order to create an airplane as we know today.</p>
                <h2>How has this technology impacted society?</h2>
                <p>The airplane his impacted society in many ways because it had made connecting the world much easier. If aircraft had not been invented we would only be using boats to travel across the ocean for any type of travel.</p>
                <h2>Interview with a friend</h2>
                <p>I interviewed the It coordinator at my school, Karvel Lewis. Without aircraft he would not be at our school because he is formally from Jamaica. Being from a different country he would have needed to catch a boat ride to come to the US and then find a mode of travel to make his way up to NH just to work in our school.</p>
                <h2>How would I sell it?</h2>
                <p>I would try and sell this product by explaining that is a faster mode of transportation and will allow us to travel across great distances with ease. If people were to question the safety of the craft I would tell them that there is no need to worry because I would have personally have tested it myself.</p>

            <div id="4069" class="tab">
                <h1>1940-1969</h1>
                <h2>The most important technologic discovery</h2>
                <p>I selected the birth of the modern computer as my most important technology of the era. The reason I selected this technology is because my whole life revolves around computers, the same goes for most people.</p>
                <h2>The person(s) responsible for brining this technology to the public</h2>
                <p>Clifford Berry and John V. Atanasoff are responsible for bringing this new technology to the public. The Professor and his student built the computer at Iowa State University between 1939 and 1942.</p>
                <h2>How has this technology impacted society?</h2>
                <p>The technology I chose has impacted society in many ways because for one I would not be taking this class if it had not been. It also has advanced many scientific/medical discoveries and been the foundation of modern society.</p>
                <h2>Interview with a friend</h2>
                <p>I again interviewed my Schools IT guy, Mr. Lewis. Mr. Lewis would not be working as our schools IT coordinator if it were not for the computer. Like me Mr. LewisÂ’s life revolves around computers, as the IT guy he has to mess around with computers all day. Computers also contributed to modern airplanes, and being that he is form a different country he again would not be here if it weren't for computers.</p>
                <h2>How would I sell it?</h2>
                <p>I would try and sell this technology persuading people that it will revolutionize the world, It will eventually make life easier and make the world a better place.</p>

            <div id="7099" class="tab">
                <h1>1970-1999</h1>
                <h2>The most important technologic discovery</h2>
                <p>I chose the creation of the World Wide Web as my most important creation because it works as a communication device for the modern world. Out of the other technologies invented in this era I chose the World Wide Web because it has a lot of meaning to me and many other people.</p>
                <h2>The person(s) responsible for brining this technology to the public</h2>
                <p>Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau are responsible for bringing this technology into the world. Both men were computer scientists, One of whom worked for CERN.</p>
                <h2>How has this technology impacted society?</h2>
                <p>The World Wide Web controls most of modern day life as we know, its the fastest form of communication as well as being the most used.</p>
                <h2>Interview with a friend</h2>
                <p>I again Interviewed my schools IT coordinator for this question, Being that he is an It coordinator he uses the Internet and Internet based software in everyday use. Without the Internet Our IT guy would not have his job because computers would probably not be as popular as they are today.</p>
                <h2>How would I sell it?</h2>
                <p>If I invented this technology I would try and sell it saying that it will revolutionize communication and would make everyday work easier and information would be easier to find.</p>
